## Introduction
This repository contains my review and some study notes for the **CAP** and **CCSP-AWS** pentesting exams by TheSecOpsGroup. It is designed to help others decide whether to purchase it and go for it, and to help others preparing for these exams.

## About the Exams
- **Issuer**: The Sec Ops Group
- **Target Audience**: security engineers, application developers, SOC analysts, penetration testers, red and blue team members and any appsec enthusiast
- **Format**: The exam includes Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) covering the syllabus. The time duration of the exam is 60 minutes. The exam will be proctored but can be taken online, anytime (on-demand) and from anywhere. Candidates scoring over 60% marks will be deemed to have successfully passed the exam and Candidates scoring over 75% marks will be deemed to have passed with a merit.

## CAP
### Title
Certified AppSec Practitioner
### Prerequisites
Candidates should have prior knowledge (both theoretical and practical) of common application security related topics such as the OWASP Top 10 issues, common security misconfigurations, best security practices, defense-in-depth measures as well as an overview of how vulnerabilities can be exploited in the real world scenario.
### My Takeaway
At the time of this writing, I passed the Certified Application Pentester (CAP) exam with merit over a year ago. Here, I’ll share my thoughts on the exam itself and my preparation approach.
I was introduced to The SecOps Group platform, its certifications, and exams shortly before taking my OSCP exam. At the time, I was already working as a full-time penetration tester, so I decided to take the CAP exam without any specific preparation.
The exam consisted of multiple-choice questions, covering both theoretical concepts and practical scenarios on how vulnerabilities can be exploited in real-world situations. Additionally, it addressed common application security topics, including:
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities,
  - Common security misconfigurations,
  - Best security practices,
  - Defense-in-depth measures.

Overall, I enjoyed taking this exam. It served as both my introduction to a new certification provider and a way to quickly evaluate my existing knowledge of application security topics. However, I would only recommend pursuing this certification if it is available at a significantly reduced price or with a substantial discount.
The reason for this recommendation is that other vendors offer better value for the cost. These alternatives often include:
  - Comprehensive study materials,
  - Practical labs,
  - Multiple exam attempts,
  - And often at a fraction of the cost.

For the same price as the CAP certification, you could also gain more practical experience by subscribing to hacking platforms such as TryHackMe (THM) or Hack The Box Academy (HTB Academy).
If you’re still curious about the CAP exam, I recommend trying their free mock exam, which is available at The SecOps Group's website. This can help you decide if the certification aligns with your goals and interests.

## CCSP-AWS
### Title
Certified Cloud Security Practitioner – AWS
### Prerequisites
Candidates should have knowledge of common cloud security misconfigurations, best security practices, defense-in-depth measures as well as an overview of monitoring and responding against the common security threats on AWS cloud.
### My Takeaway
I successfully passed with merit the Certified Cloud Security Practitioner – AWS (CCSP-AWS) certification exam offered by The SecOps Group.
I came across this certifications during a 90% discount last year and only during the end of 2024 decided to go for it. I approached the CCSP-AWS exam with a mix of prior experience from both the MCRTA (CWL) and VulnMachines from the SecOps Group.
The exam featured a combination of theoretical multiple-choice questions and practical scenario-based challenges. It tested the ability to identify, mitigate, and remediate cloud-specific vulnerabilities within an AWS environment. Core topics included:
- AWS-specific services and configurations, such as IAM, S3, EC2, and VPC security.
- Cloud security frameworks and best practices.
- Threat detection and mitigation strategies specific to AWS environments.
- Principles of shared responsibility in cloud security.
- Real-world misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in AWS that attackers exploit.

The exam went beyond theoretical concepts, providing scenario-based questions that required understanding how security issues manifest in real AWS environments. 
However, while the exam was well-structured, I believe its value proposition compared to other cloud certifications/courses or labs could be better. The lack of included study materials, hands-on labs, or multiple exam attempts makes the overall package less competitive. Certifications like AWS Certified Security from Amazon, ACRTP from Pwnedlabs, or labs like cloudgoat from RhinoSecurityLabs or Electra from PwnedLabs, provide a more comprehensive learning experience at a similar or even lower price point.
While the CCSP-AWS exam may appeal to those seeking a focused introduction to cloud security certification, I would only recommend it if:
- The exam is offered at a significant discount, or
- You’re looking for a way to quickly assess your cloud security knowledge.

For those exploring cloud security certifications, investing in resources like AWS Certified Security – Specialty or practical subscription-based platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, or PwnedLabs will provide a better balance of cost, learning materials, and value.
My final thoughts are that the CCSP-AWS exam was a useful benchmark for evaluating my cloud security knowledge, particularly within AWS. However, its high cost and limited resources make it a bad starting option. If you're unsure whether this certification aligns with your goals, I recommend trying their free mock exams, available at The SecOps Group's website. This will help you determine if their approach fits your needs.
